Visibility
---------------------

- public: Accessible by all and create a view method by default (uses more gas than the rest)
- private: Only accessible inside the contract that holds it
- internal: (Default) Accessible only in the contract that holds it AND inherits it 
- external: NOT accessible in the class or when inherited. Only accessible from outside. (least amount of gas)
