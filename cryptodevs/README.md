    // User Registers in...
    
    /*
    * THINGS TO CHECK:
    * - See if the buttons work
    * - Is the password hidden?
    * - Is it a valid email
    * - Login session time
    * - If username/email/phone, it must be unique
    * - Have you already registered? Or are you unverified?
    * - Does your password contain letters, numbers, and special characters?
    * - Is your password more than 15 characters?
    * - Is your IP a blacklisted IP?
    *
